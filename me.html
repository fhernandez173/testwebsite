	<h1>Some things about me!</h1>
		<p>
		I have been learning about programming extensively for about year, around the time I was in Year Up. I did not know where to gain knowledge or what to do with it if I had gotten what i wanted, then again I did not see the oppontunities  have taken that are now influencing my decisions. I like art, technology and sciences that improve our lives.

	<h1>What I'd like to do in the near future</h1>
		<p>
		Being driven by creativity and creating various things, I'd liek to continue this overall theme throught out life. I want to be able to create the designs I choose and carry out the whole process front point a, the idea, to point c, the product. Within the next five years or so, I want to immersed in the development world, not just creating and stabilizing products for others, but continue self-improvement and development through personal projects
